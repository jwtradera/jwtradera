- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @jwtradera
 
I have developed NFT marketplaces and dex protocols including swap, farming & defi 2.0 like that.
Iâ€™m good at EIP-2535, EIP-3668 protocols and also DAO using curveFinance logic.
Already passed many audits including certik and others.
 
In additional, about dapp experiences, I have written many dapps using react + web3 + uniswap fork.
 
Regards
John
